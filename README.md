# Server-Client Architecture
This project implements a client-authoritative architecture with server-side validation. In this system, the client initiates and handles state changes, while the server is responsible for validating those actionsâ€”either approving or rejecting them.

This design choice was made to offload heavy processing from the server, helping reduce network congestion and latency. The result is a more efficient, responsive experience. To maintain security and integrity, the server backend includes validation logic and protections against script injection attempts.
